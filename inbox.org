Why do you procrastinate?

Is there really a reason, or are those just some imaginary doubts.
What is the root of it, and can/do you have to do anything with it.

**** Visualize the end result

Goals should be clear.  And they should be defined.

Don't just make yourself do any work (which is hard), but rather try
to move torward some outcome (reward).

It also help to differenciate betweet what's good now, and what's good
in the long run.

**** Break down your goal into smaller chunks

**** Eat that frog

And than wait for reward

**** Timer and deep focus

Pomodore to stay most effective.  Single-task with minimal
distractions, all the rest can wait fifteen minutes.

**** Rewart yourself

And do it after.
