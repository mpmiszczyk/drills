Build your own Light Sabre

*** Notes
As MasterCraftsman you are expected to be able to build your own
tools, not just use what's given.  All woodworking shops have
metalworking stations just for this porpouse.  End even in todays
power-machine down all good craftsman's can and are building they own
rigs and templates.  It's nothing now (or Sci-Fi)
